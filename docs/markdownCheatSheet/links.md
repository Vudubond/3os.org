# Links

## Basic link

``` markdown

```

Renders to (hover over the link, there is no tooltip):

[Assemble](http://assemble.io)

## Link With Title

``` markdown
[Upstage](https://github.com/upstage/ "Visit Upstage!")
```

Renders to (hover over the link, there should be a tooltip):

[Upstage](https://github.com/upstage/ "Visit Upstage!")

## Relative Link

```markdown
[Relative Link](../index.md "Relative Link")
```

__Result:__

[Relative Link](../index.md "Relative Link")

## Link With "Open In New Tab"

Use {target=_blank} to a link

```markdown
[Example](https://example.com){target=_blank}
```

```markdown
[Relative Link With New Tab](../index.md "Opens new tab for relative home page"){target=_blank}  
[Reference Link With New Tab](https://github.com/fire1ce/3os.org/ "Opens new tab for reference link"){target=_blank}
```

__Result:__

[Relative Link With New Tab](../index.md "Opens new tab for relative home page"){target=_blank}  
[Reference Link With New Tab](https://github.com/fire1ce/3os.org/ "Opens new tab for reference link"){target=_blank}

## Anchor Links

Named anchors enable you to jump to the specified anchor point on the same page. For example, each of these chapters:

```markdown
* [Jumps to Links](#links)
```

will jump to these sections:

* [Jumps to Links](#links)

__NOTE__ that specific placement of the anchor tag seems to be arbitrary. They are placed inline here since it seems to be unobtrusive, and it works.

## Mail To Link With Icon

```markdown
mail link with emoji [ðŸ“§](mailto:example@example.com)
```

__Result:__

mail link with emoji [ðŸ“§](mailto:example@example.com)
