# Linux General Topics

## Service Status/Start/Stop/Enabling On Boot

```bash
systemctl status httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl stop httpd
systemctl enable httpd
```

## Run Script On Boot - Crontab

Only add sudo if your script needs superuser privileges. Then add this to your crontab:

```bash
(sudo) crontab -e
```

Add to the end of the Cront tab:

```bash
@reboot /path/to/script.sh
```

## Redirect Output to a File and Stdout With _tee_

The command you want is named `tee`:

```bash
foo | tee output.file
```

For example, if you only care about stdout:

```bash
ls -a | tee output.file
```

If you want to include stderr, do:

```bash
program [arguments...] 2>&1 | tee outfile
```

2>&1 redirects channel 2 (stderr/standard error) into channel 1 (stdout/standard output), such that both is written as stdout. It is also directed to the given output file as of the tee command.

Furthermore, if you want to append to the log file, use tee -a as:

```bash
program [arguments...] 2>&1 | tee -a outfile
```

## Add Permanent Path to Application

First find the location of the Application/Service:

```bash
find / -name ApplicationName
```

Go to the path where the application is located

```bash
cd "../../../ApplicationName"
```

Run this command for ZSH:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="'$(pwd)':$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
```

Run this command for "Bash Profile":

```bash
echo 'export PATH="'$(pwd)':$PATH"' >> ~/.profile && source ~/.profile
```

Run this command for "Bash":

```bash
echo 'export PATH="'$(pwd)':$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

## Create Symbolic Links

To create a symbolic link in Unix/Linux, at the terminal prompt, enter:

```bash
ln -s source_file target_file
```

to remove symbolic link use the `rm` command on the link

## Set the Timezone

```bash
sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
```

__or__

Set the timezone

To set the timezone of your system clock do the following:

```bash
cp /usr/share/zoneinfo/Israel /etc/localtime
```

## Disable IPv6

For current session:

```bash
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/<interface-name>/disable_ipv6
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/eth0/disable_ipv6
```

Permanent:

edit /etc/sysctl.conf and add to the end of the config

```bash
net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
```

Save. Then run:

```bash
sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.conf
```

## Max connections on Linux

Add to /etc/sysctl.conf:

```bash
fs.file-max = 70000
net.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle=0
net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout = 10
net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 15000 61000
net.core.somaxconn = 1024
net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 2000
```

## Rescan Drives for the OS

```bash
echo "- - -" > /sys/class/scsi_host/host0/scan
echo 1 > /sys/class/scsi_device/2\:0\:0\:0/device/rescan
```

## Find PTR Owner - Reversal Look Up

```bash
dig 0.168.192.in-addr.arpa. NS
```

## Fix Locales

For bash shell run:

```bash
echo "export LC_ALL=C" >> ~/.profile && source ~/.profile
```

For zsh shell run:

```bash
echo "export LC_ALL=C" >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
```

## Open Last Edited File

```bash
less `ls -dx1tr /usr/local/cpanel/logs/cpbackup/*|tail -1`
```

## Kill Process That Runs More Than X Time

Kill cgi after 30 secs:

```bash
for i in `ps -eo pid,etime,cmd|grep cgi|awk '$2 > "00:30" {print $1}'`; do kill $i; done
```

## Update Date and Time on Linux Server

```bash
sudo ntpd -qg; sudo hwclock -w
```

## Generate CSR with OpenSSL

Generate key:

```bash
openssl genrsa -out private.key 2048
```

Generate CSR:

```bash
openssl req -new -sha256 -key private.key -out mycsr.csr
```
